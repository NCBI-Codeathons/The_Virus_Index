# The_Virus_Index
A Federated Index of Virus Metadata and Hyperdata in Public Repositories


# What we'd like to do?
* Collaborate with other teams to define a data model
  * Give us your use case!
* Put the data on a cloud resource (BigQuery)
  * Ideas for features
     * Biome
     * Domains 
     * Geographical location
     * Is there hierarchical data?
     * Temporal data
     * Data already in SRA: Taxonomy?
* Provide convenient access to this data (i.e.: not for programmers only). 
  * Possible examples: 
    * [NCBI virus webpage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/) [old page](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/viruses/)
    * [EBI Virus page](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/genomes/virus.html)
  * Get data into [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)?
  * How would researchers like to access this data (from which purview)? Genomic context?
    * Complete genomes, specific genes (philogenetic markers). 
    * Contig based?
